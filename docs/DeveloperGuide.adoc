== Introduction
Welcome to *PlanMySem*!

*PlanMySem* is a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
*PlanMySem* automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

*PlanMySem* is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, *PlanMySem* utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

{zwsp}

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `PlanMySem.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `PlanMySem.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the *PlanMySem* branding and refer to the `https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/Main.java[`Main`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Common,*`Common`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The following class plays an important role at the architecture level, the App consists of four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

//For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `Logic.java` class.
//
//.Class Diagram of overall application.
//image::OverallClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteSlot.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

The sections below give more details of each component.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of just a TextField `commandInput` and a TextArea `outputConsole`.
This application is mainly a text-based application, hence there are not many components here.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands read from `commandInput`, using the `Logic` component.
* Displays `commandResult` to the user via `outputConsole`.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

the `Logic` component,

.  Uses the `parser` class to parse the user command.
**  This results in a `Command` object which is executed.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a _Slot_).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to display results, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::SDforDeleteSlot.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Overall structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component

* stores the Planner data.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/planmysem/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component saves the Planner data in XML format and read it back.

This functionality is provided via Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), a software framework that maps Java classes to XML representations.
In summary, JAXB allows storing and retrieving data in memory in any XML format.
More information about JAXB can be obtain from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/index.html[Oracle].

To represents XML content as Java objects, "adapted" classes are used to represent and allow conversion of un-mappable objects into mappable objects.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[Design-Common]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `PlanMySem.common` package.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[Planner-Initialization]]
=== Initialization of the Planner and its Semester

The `Planner` and its `Semester` has to be initialized for *PlanMySem* to work as all other features of *PlanMySem* would
interact with this `Semester` object. The initialization is automated and dynamic to ensure sustainability.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Current Implementation

Upon launching *PlanMySem*, the initialization of the `Planner` and its `Semester` would be implemented via two steps:

1. Automatically generate the academic calendar from the current date.
2. Setup current `Semester` from the academic calendar.

The academic calendar is dynamically generated by invoking the function `generateSemester` in the `Semester` class.
The function will first retrieve the current date from the system clock to determine which academic year it is.
As a new academic year starts from August, it can be determined from the month of the current date.

* If the current date is before August, the current academic year is "the previous year / current year". +
e.g. If the date is 25/3/2019, the academic year is "2018 / 2019".
* If the current date is after August, the current academic year is "the current year / next year". +
e.g. If the date is 25/8/2019, the academic year is "2019 / 2020".

After determining the academic year, the details of the semesters will be generated. All the weeks of the academic
year can be calculated from the first day of semester 1 since each semester has a fixed amount of weeks.

[NOTE]
Semester 1 of the academic year starts with an orientation week and will always begin from the first Monday of August.

* Semester 1 has 18 weeks (inclusive of orientation week) and semester 2 has 17 weeks.
* The vacation between semester 1 and 2 has 5 weeks.
* The vacation between academic years will have 12 or 13 weeks depending on the starting week of the next academic year.

Each week of the year will correspond to an academic week and this information will be stored in a `HashMap` for efficient retrieval. This
`HashMap` can be used to determine the academic week given a date (by finding out the week of the year for that date).
The tables below shows an example of the relation between academic week and the week of the year for academic year 2018/2019.

.Weeks in academic year 2018/2019, Semester 1.

//
//.[.underline]#Weeks in academic year 2018/2019, Semester 2.#
//image::Sem2.png[width="790"]

Hence, the information listed below can be determined from the current date.

* Current academic week
* Current academic semester
* Current academic year
* Number of weeks in current academic semester
* Start date of current academic semester
* End date of current academic semester

These information would be assigned to the `Semester` object upon initialization of the `Planner`.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Design Considerations

This section details an aspect which we carefully considered for the initialization of the `Planner` and its `Semester`.

===== Aspect: Generation of academic calendar

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Generate academic calendar by performing calculations from the current date.
** Pros: Generation of academic calendar is dynamic and will work for future dates.
** Cons: Computationally expensive as many operations have to be performed.

* *Alternative 2:* Retrieve academic calendar from a pre-generated file.
** Pros: Generation of academic calendar is efficient and not prone to calculation errors.
** Cons: Requires the pre-generated file which may be accidentally edited or deleted by the user.

We chose alternative 1 as we wanted *PlanMySem* to be sustainable and continue working for future dates. The cons for alternative 2 also outweighs the cons for alternative 1 as editing
or deleting the pre-generated file could potentially break the application. Hence, we implemented alternative 1 as it is
a more suitable choice.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Parser / Command Format and Structure

Due to the flexibility and huge variation of the envisioned command format and structures, it was decided that it was more appropriate to create a new Parser
instead of relying on the existing regex implementation in AB3 for heavy parsing.

The AB3 parser was heavily modified to serve unordered command parameters as well as to allow more flexibility such that mistakes in commands will still be
interpreted as valid as long as the "minimal" set of parameters are present. Regex is currently only used to retrieve the command keywords and arguments.
Arguments are then parsed via 2 different methods/techniques according to the format and structure of the command keyword.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Current Implementation

* Ordering of parameters are ignored when possible.
* Repeated parameters are ignored. The first parameter of the same "type" are taken as valid, the rest are discarded.
* Alternate formats of commands are implemented to give freedom of choice and cater to different types of users with different personalities and comfort levels.
* Shortened versions of command keywords are implemented to give ways for users to shorten commands and be more efficient.

Hence, parameters in *PlanMySem* can be categorised into 2 categories:

. Prefixed parameters such as `n/NAME`, `st/START_TIME`, `des/DESCRIPTION`, etc.
. Non-Prefixed parameters, A.K.A. keywords, such as `INDEX`, `TYPE_OF_VIEW`. etc.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Parsing Prefixed Parameters

To retrieve parameters, the function `private static HashMap<String, Set<String>> getParametersWithArguments(String args)` can be called.
The keys of the returned `HashMap` represent prefixes while the values represent the prefix's parameters, held in a set.
This allows for easy, quick and efficient access to specific prefixes and its parameters; O(1) access, insertion and removal.

The results of `getParametersWithArguments` can be interpreted in these manners:

* When the returned set of parameters, to a specific prefix, is `null`, then both the prefix and parameters was not keyed in at all.
* When the returned set of parameters, to a specific prefix, is not `null` but contains empty `strings` such that `string.isEmpty()` returns true, then the prefix was keyed in but the parameter was left blank.

[IMPORTANT]
The values of the returned `HashMap` is a `Set`, hence, there is no need to handle repeated parameters of a specific prefix as they will be automatically discarded.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Parsing Keywords

To retrieve keywords, the function `private String getStartingArgument(String args)` can be called.
Here, keywords are thought of as parameters that are not prefixed.
In *PlanMySem*, keywords are utilized in command structures when they are to be used alone or when order of parameters are important.
In such cases, there is no logical need for prefixing as the meaning of these parameters can be identified.

The results of `getStartingArgument` can be interpreted in these manners:

* When the keyword is null, then the parameter was not keyed in.
* When the keyword data type does not match the intended, then the parameter was keyed in wrongly or is mis-ordered.

[NOTE]
Additional keywords are *not* handled and ignored to provide ease of use and cater to user mistakes.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Design Considerations

Here are the considerations that led to the new parsing system.
In both cases, choices were made were largely due to the fact that they provide a better user experience and ease of use.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Handling repeated parameters

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* When possible, accept repeated parameters.
** Pros: Less computationally expensive and allow users to make minor mistakes.
** Cons: User errors may be misinterpreted and hence wrong actions may be executed.

* *Alternative 2:* Always accept and handle repeated parameters.
** Pros: Errors are shown to the user so that the invalid command may be fixed.
** Cons: Force user to rewrite commands, even in the event of simple/minor mistakes, and thus may hinder user experience and ease of use.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Handling order of parameters

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Parse parameters without regards to order.
** Pros: Greater user experience due to greater ease of use.
** Cons: More computationally expensive and tougher development process due to more cases to care for, requires manual parsing.

* *Alternative 2:* Accept only a specific ordering of parameters.
** Pros: Less computationally expensive and short development process, able to use existing regex solutions in AB3.
** Cons: Greatly hinder user experience as order of parameters have no relation to meaning of commands.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Future Implementation

Though the current implementation has much flexibility, there is more that can be done to elevate user experience to the next level.
These are some possible enhancements:

1. Parse a larger variety of date and time formats.
2. Parse time as a single parameter instead of two.
3. Enhance function calls to retrieve prepended parameters and keywords to handle trivial cases that should invoke `ParseException`.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Slot Management

_Slot_ Management involves mainly the interaction between the users and their _slots_.

The section below will describe in detail the Current Implementation, Design Considerations and Future Implementation of the Slot Management.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Current Implementation

Users are able to perform three actions (or commands), though a small variety of methods, involving _slots_:

* `Add`
    ** Add multiple slots via the _recursion_ system.
    ** Add a single slot via omitting the _recursion_ system.
* `Edit`
    ** Edit multiple _slots_ via _tags_.
    ** Edit a single _slot_ via _index_.
* `Delete`
    ** Delete _slots_ via _tags_.
    ** Delete a single _slot_ via _index_.

The `Add` command heavily relies on the _recursion_ system to select multiple dates in which to add the same slot to multiple days.
Additionally, the `Add` command also allows users to input _tags_ to tag _slots_.

The `Edit` and `Delete` command then makes use of the _tagging_ system to then select multiple slots for editing/deleting.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Design Considerations

Here are the considerations regarding slot management.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Wrapping of data in `Slot`

The topic of whether to wrap all primitives and `Strings`, in Java, is contentious.
However, in this case of *PlanMySem*, there are no possible invalid values for any of the data that `Slot` holds, other than the `/` character that would have already been handled by `parser`.
For instance, any `String` is a valid `name` and the same goes for `location`, `description` and etc; wrapping these data will not achieve any narrowing of possible valid inputs.

Hence, data in `Slot` are not wrapped. This is in accordance to the You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI) principle.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Storing and accessing `Slots`

* *Alternative 1 (current implementation):* Use of `Map`, such as `HashMap` to store `Days` that store `Slots`.
** Pros: `HashMap` allows for easier and faster, O(1) access time, access of particular `Day` according to date.
** Cons: This requires splitting of the calendar into days, as such there is no easy way to account for `Slots` that occur across days.

* *Alternative 2:* Store `Slots` in a huge list.
** Pros: Allows for easier access by "index" and offers flexibility, for example, in the time of slots.
** Cons: Expensive to access, add and remove items. Furthermore, it is extremely expensive to collect slots that occur in a day, a very important and most likely to be a commonly used feature.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the benefits of quick and easy access to days outweigh the disadvantages involve with forbidding slots than span over a day.
After all, there are few cases of slots crossing the boundaries of a day, over midnight.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Future Implementation

===== Create a class to represent `Days`, instead of utilising a `HashMap`

Currently, `Days` are held in a HashMap of key `LocalDate` and value `Day`. While this works without any loss in performance, this causes duplication of code and removes some key concepts of abstraction.
For example, there are code blocks dedicated to retrieving days or slots that could have been placed into this new class. This is an issue as these code have nothing to do with for instance, `Semester` but they are placed there.

Therefore, this needs to be implemented in the future to achieve less coupling, more cohesion and respect the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and Separation of Concerns Principle (SoC).
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== `Planner` to hold multiple `Semesters`

While *PlanMySem* now allow users to work on the current semester, it is unable to cater to future semesters. For instance when a semester is about to end, users are not able to plan ahead for the coming semester.

This is an issue that plagues user experience and is a significant problem. To solve this issue, `Planner` needs to hold multiple semesters in a `List` and more features need to be included to allow saving, loading and switching of semesters and etc.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== List feature

==== Current Implementation
The list function supports searching using a single keyword. +

The keyword is compared to all names/tags of all `Slots` existing in `Planner`. +

If an exact match is found, the `Slot` will be added to the output list.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Find feature

==== Current Implementation
The find function supports searching using a single keyword. +

[NOTE]
The name/tag of the `Slot` MUST contain the specified keyword in order for a match to occur. Completely different keywords
do not constitute a match. +

The matching `Slots` are then weighted based on their name/tag's <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> from the keyword.

[TIP]
A low <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> is attributed to a high level of similarity between the name/tag and the keyword.
(A value of 0 constitutes an exact match.) +
The maximum Levenshtein Distance set in `PlanMySem` is 20.

The weighted `Slots` are inserted into a `PriorityQueue` and the closest matching `Slots`
will be polled into the output list. +

Upon executing the `find` command with valid parameters (refer to <<UserGuide#view, UserGuide.adoc>> for `find` usage),
a sequence of events is executed. The sequence of events illustrated in the Sequence Diagram below will be in reference to the execution
of a `find n/keyword` command. The sequence of events are as follows:

1. Upon calling the `execute` method of the `Logic` component, the `Logic` component would then parse the `find n/keyword`
command.
2. This results in a `FindCommand` object which is executed with name parameter 'keyword' and null tag.
3. The command execution will call the `getDays` method of the `FindCommand` object which retrieves data from the
`Model` component (i.e. retrieving data from the current `Semester`). +
4. `FindCommand` will execute the `getDiscoveredNames` method to find the closely matching `Slots` with names containing 'keyword'.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.
6. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to display results, such as displaying help to
the user.

To give a graphical summary of the above process, a Sequence Diagram detailing the execution of the `find n/keyword` command is provided below.

[[view]]
=== View feature

This feature presents the planner in different formats to the user. The available formats are the month view, week view,
and the day view. This section will detail how this feature is implemented.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Current Implementation

Upon invoking the `view` command with valid parameters (refer to <<UserGuide#view, UserGuide.adoc>> for `view` usage),
a sequence of events is executed. For clarity, the sequence of events will be in reference to the execution
of a `view month` command. A graphical representation is also included in the Sequence Diagram below for your reference
when following through the sequence of events. The sequence of events are as follows:

1. Upon calling the `execute` method of the `Logic` component, the `Logic` component would then parse the `view month`
command.
[NOTE]
The `view` command can be parsed into only 3 general types of views which are the month, week or day view as
specified in the command parameter.
2. This results in a `ViewCommand` object which is executed with the `month` parameter passed in.
3. The command execution will call the `displayMonthView` method of the `ViewCommand` object which retrieves data from the
`Model` component (i.e. retrieving data from the current `Semester`).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to display results, such as displaying help to
the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram upon executing the `view month` command.

.Interactions between components for the `view month` Command
image::ViewMonthSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

The 3 general types of view (month, week, day) are generated by the methods `displayMonthView`, `displayWeekView`,
`displayDetailedWeekView`, `displayDayView` from the `ViewCommand` class and the implementation of these methods is
explained below.

`displayMonthView` method displays all the months of the current semester in a monthly calendar format. Each academic week
of the semester is also indicated in the display. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into 3 parts:

1. Print month header (e.g. January 2019) and calculate required amount of whitespace before the 1st of the month.
2. Print all days of the month using a loop.
   * Append academic week after each Saturday or last day of month.
3. Repeat parts 1 and 2 for every month in the semester.

`displayWeekView` method displays the weekly calendar format of a specified week. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header (e.g. Week 13 of Sem 2).
2. Retrieve all days of the week and for each day, retrieve its _slots_ into an `ArrayList`.
3. For each day, print the _slot_ details (only start time, end time and a shortened title) and remove the _slot_ from
the `ArrayList`.
4. Repeat step 3 until the `ArrayList` of _slots_ for each day is empty.

`displayDayView` method displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified day. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into 2 parts:

1. Retrieve all _slots_ for the specified day.
2. Print all details of each _slot_ found.

`displayDetailedWeekView` method displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified week since `displayWeekView` only shows
 a formatted and summarised week view. The implementation of this method can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header (e.g. Week 13 of Sem 2).
2. Retrieve all days of the week.
3. For each day, print all details of all _slots_ via the `displayDayView` method.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Design Considerations

This section details our considerations for the implementation of the `view` feature.

===== Aspect: Functionality of `view week` command

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Option for user to display a formatted summarised week view or a detailed week view.
** Pros: The formatted summarised week view is uncluttered. User given the choice and flexibility for the week view.
** Cons: User is required to spend a little more time to specify an additional parameter in the `view week` command.

* *Alternative 2:* Only a single formatted week view which displays details of all _slots_ in the specified week.
** Pros: Efficient for the user as user is only required to enter a single command to view all details of all _slots_.
** Cons: The formatted week view will be too cluttered as there are too many _slots_ and lots of details. Formatting is
an issue as well as details of each _slot_ can be of varying lengths.

Alternative 1 was chosen to be implemented as it gives the user freedom of choice to select the degree of details to be
displayed in the output of the `view week` command. The output of alternative 1 is also less cluttered than alternative 2
and thus enhances the presentability of *PlanMySem*.

{zwsp}

=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPlanner`. +
[NOTE]
Only `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` commands can be undone/redone. +

It extends `Planner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `plannerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current planner state in its history.
* `VersionedPlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous planner state from its history.
* `VersionedPlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone planner state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPlanner()`, `Model#undoPlanner()` and `Model#redoPlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPlanner` will be initialized with the initial planner state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th `Slot` in the planner. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitPlanner()`, causing the modified state of the planner after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `plannerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted planner state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

Step 3. The user executes `add n/CS2113T ...` to add a new slot. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPlanner()`, causing another modified planner state to be saved into the `plannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPlanner()`, so the planner state will not be saved into the `plannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the `Slot` was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous planner state, and restores the planner to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial planner state, then there are no previous planner states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoPlanner()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the planner to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `plannerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest planner state, then there are no undone planner states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the planner, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitPlanner()`, `Model#undoPlanner()` or `Model#redoPlanner()`. Thus, the `plannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPlanner()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `plannerStateList`, all planner states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire planner.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of planner states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedPlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Data Encryption / Decryption feature

The storage file "PlanMySem.txt" is encrypted to prevent easy access of the user's calendar.
We are encrypting and decrypting the data using the Java Cypher class.
This feature is implemented through creating a Encryptor that contains encrypt and decrypt methods. The encrypt method takes a String object as an argument and returns a encrypted String object. The decrypt method takes in a String object as an argument and returns the decrypted message as a String object.

The encryption is done using AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding. The key used for encryption/decryption is generated randomly and stored in a file named "KeyStorage.jceks". No password is required from the user to retrieve this key, but a password input can be added in the KeyStorage.java class to improve security. +

A initialization vector (IV) is required for the Cipher Block Chain (CBC) mode of encryption. A random IV is generated and appended at the beginning of the data before being stored. The IV is then retrieved from the same file to decrypt the data.

Encryption of the data is done automatically before the file is saved. In the implementation, the AdaptedPlanner object is first marshaled into a StringWriter before being encrypted and written into the file. This is to ensure that the data is JAXB formatted and the save algorithm is unaffected.
Similarly, decryption of the data is done automatically before it is loaded. In the implementation, the file is read and decrypted and parsed into a StringReader object. The StringReader object is then un-marshaled and loaded. This is to ensure that the file is converted back into a JAXB object before being loaded and the load algorithm is unaffected.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Data Exporting / Exporting feature

The user can export the current planner into a .ics file to use in external calendar applications. The .ics file will contain the names of the slots in the SUMMARY field and the descriptions in the DESCRIPTION field. This command automatically exports into the main directory and names the file “PlanMySem.ics”. Future updates can include user input to allow saving the file in another directory and naming the file.
We have chosen to use the iCalendar format due to its popularity and its use in applications such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook and NUSmods.

In our implementation, we have chosen not to export the tags into the .ics file. This is because iCalendar does not have in-built tag fields. This means that other applications that import .ics will not be able to use the tags.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

===== Aspect: Exporting tags into .ics file.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ignore tags when exporting.
** Pros: Easier to implement as iCalendar does not have in-built tag fields.
** Cons: Not all the information about the slots will be retained.
** Reason for choice: We do not have much control over other applications, and importing and exporting .ics within *PlanMySem* can be done using the storage .txt file.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the notes field and a tag identifier to save the tags.
** Pros: All the information from the semester will be exported.
** Cons: Requires other applications to be coded to read these tag identifiers and also to store and use the tags in their functions.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

// TODO: Julian please fill this section
//Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
There is no need for manual configuration of the `Semester` as it is initialized dynamically as mentioned in
<<Planner-Initialization>>.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Types of tests

//We have two types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `PlanMySem.commons.UtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `PlanMySem.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `PlanMySem.logicManager.LogicTest`, `PlanMySem.parse,ParserTest`
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `Logic` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/PlanMySem/Main.java[`Main.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

=== Managing Dependencies

Projects often depends on third-party libraries.
For example, *PlanMySem* depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing.
Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle.
For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

//== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started
//
//Suggested path for new programmers:
//
//1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.
//
//2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.
//
//[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
//=== Improving each component
//
//Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).
//
//[discrete]
//==== `Logic` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logicManager`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.
//
//. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
//+
//****
//* Hints
//** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
//** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
//* Solution
//** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
//** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
//** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
//** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
//****
//
//[discrete]
//==== `Model` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logicManager`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
//
//. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
//+
//****
//* Hints
//** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
//** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logicManager of deleting tags?
//**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logicManager. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
//* Solution
//** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
//** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.

//==== `Ui` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.
//
//. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

//** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
//** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
//* Solution
//** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
//** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
//*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

//** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
//* Solution
//** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
//** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
//** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:

//==== `Storage` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.
//
//. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

//[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
//=== Creating a new command: `remark`
//
//By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.
//
//*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.
//
//==== Description
//Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
//Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`
//
//Examples:
//
//* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
//Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
//* `remark 1 r/` +
//Removes the remark for the first person.
//
//==== Step-by-step Instructions
//
//===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
//Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logicManager of `remark` later.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
//. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.
//
//===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
//Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
//. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
//. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
//for `RemarkCommandParser`.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logicManager/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.
//
//===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
//Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
//. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.
//
//===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
//We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
//. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.
//
//===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
//Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample model (delete your `model/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample model when you launch it.)
//
//===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
//We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.
//
//===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
//Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
//. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].
//
//===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
//Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.
//
//===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logicManager
//We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logicManager for our `remark` command.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Replace the logicManager in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logicManager to modify the remarks of a person.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logicManager works.
//
//==== Full Solution
//
//See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.
