* This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Address Book application *written in OOP fashion*. It has a very basic GUI.
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as
the main programming language.
* It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* than what students
usually write in data structure modules.

*What's different from level 2*

* A simple GUI added to replace the Text UI.
* A `Logic` class added together with a `LogicTest` class.
* Appendices added to <<DeveloperGuide#, Developer Guide>>

*Useful Links*

* <<UserGuide#, User Guide>>
* <<DeveloperGuide#, Developer Guide>>
* <<LearningOutcomes#, Learning Outcomes>>
